# Generics

The purpose of this project is to practice the use of Generics, which are particularly useful in Java!

Design

The object of this assignment is to transform a Non-Generic class into a Generic one. My plan is to start with the superclass Node and work my way down to the Doubly Linked subclass. Once I have modified the provided DLL.java source code from GeeksforGeeks, I will demonstrate the use of created three Doubly Linked Lists for Integers, Strings, and Doubles in a Demo class. The main parts of the DLL hierarchical structure that need changing are the type of Object that can be passed in a Node and the type of list that can be created.
